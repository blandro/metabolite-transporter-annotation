Take 2.A.1.3.6 as an example.
Some of its GO terms are defined, others are not.
And they differ in specificity.
The transporter can use H+, Na+ or K+.


Complete DeepTMHMM
Filter out transporters that have substrates with children in Chebi
Extract MW, charge, polarity, InChI, SMILES
Dive into ontology of the transporters

Find the final children with no other children
SMILES and InChI are probably smart to dive into
Maybe use as they are, or extract some data from them to my pipeline
UNDERSTAND THEM

Go from leaf children to TCDB number, either through Chebi, UniProt or GOterms.

SMILES:
Examples of stereochemistry that cannot be encoded into a SMILES include:
* Gross conformational left or right handedness such as helices
* Mechanical interferences, such as rotatable bonds that are constrained by mechanical interferences
* Gross conformational stereochemistry such as the shape of a protein after folding
