Take 2.A.1.3.6 as an example.
Some of its GO terms are defined, others are not.
And they differ in specificity.
The transporter can use H+, Na+ or K+.


Complete DeepTMHMM
Filter out transporters that have substrates with children in Chebi x
Extract MW, charge, polarity, InChI, SMILES (not InChi) x
Dive into ontology of the transporters

Find the final children with no other children x
SMILES and InChI are probably smart to dive into -> Only use SMILES x
Maybe use as they are, or extract some data from them to my pipeline
UNDERSTAND THEM

SMILES:
Examples of stereochemistry that cannot be encoded into a SMILES include:
* Gross conformational left or right handedness such as helices
* Mechanical interferences, such as rotatable bonds that are constrained by mechanical interferences
* Gross conformational stereochemistry such as the shape of a protein after folding
