# metabolite-transporter-annotation

A project trying to annotate metabolite transporters and their respective substrates in cells. If succesful, an ML based classification system might predict transport reactions based on protein features, and might suggest other, similar substrates transportable by the proteins. Eventually, a pipeline validation will be done on the genomes of well-studied microorganisms to test and compare.
